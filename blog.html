        <p class="Trevor1">In South Africa specifically, Tsonga culture had a fundamental belief that a man owns the family and men are the ones to decide what he wants to do with the family. Again in this culture women were supposed to bow while the men sat there waiting
            for women to cook food.So sad, Right? The same thing to Abel, he wanted traditional marriage with a traditional wife because he wanted to treat his wife in the same way as his culture. Abel couldn 't even question if what he was doing was
            right. Instead,what he wanted was just respect while he was making no sense in the community and everything around him.”You want me to respect you as a man,then act like a man! Drinking your money in the street, and where are your child's
            diapers?! Earn Your respect” . The time came when Patricia married Unfortunately, Abel ended up falling in love with independent woman Patricia who had a very strong personality. </p>

            <p class="Trevor2">Trevor Noah had a very bad life from his childhood Knowing that he was born illegally in a community, being hidden so that they can not punish his<br> parents,being only a colored person, etc.Trevor Noah's personality was different from any
                other personality I have ever heard because he uses humour in very hard<br> situations which helps him move from difficult situations and make friends. If I give an example where he was Trevor, his mom threw him out of the car,
                <br> that was a very huge thing to be thrown out of a working car, but instead of Noah being mad at his mom he has just loathed out which makes the situation not hard. Another time is when Trevor drunk the blood of Jesus.It doesn't make
                sense for really, how can someone steal the blood of Jesus , that was a very hard situation that <br> could even make him get suspended from the school, but his humour made him explain himself and he has got very many friends from that
                situation. Trevor now has used humour<br> in the school, home, community to make friends and connect with other people since he belonged nowhere and everywhere as he said it by himself.
